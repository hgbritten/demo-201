# LAB 2

## Guessing Game for Lab 2

This web page is a basic guessing game that asks you to guess information about me, Tim Egorov. No repercussions for guessing wrong (i.e., no loops were used), but hopefully that'll be added in the future. 

The page also greets you if you enter your name, with a specialized greeting if you enter "Tim" when prompted to enter your name.
