    <h1>About Tim Egorov</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>Short Biography</h2>
                My name is Tim Egorov. I emigrated from Russia in 1992, when I was 4 years old. My parents still speak to me primarily in Russian, but <i>my</i> speaking skills are fairly low-level.
            </br></br>
                I am a fan of hiking, dogs, video games, exercise, and learning about history and linguistics. I used to hold 2 Washington State records for powerlifting, and my heaviest deadlift was 515 pounds.
        <h2>Education History</h2>
                I attended Washington State University where I majored in Philosophy Pre-law, and received minors in Ethics in Political Science.

                I am currently a student at Code Fellows, where I aim to specialize in JavaScript or Python.
            </br>
        <h2>Job Experience</h2>
                I have just about 10 years sales experience, getting my start in the beverage distribution industry. I have also sold SaaS, promotional products, and high-end office furniture.
            </br>
        <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
                My personal goals include completing Code Fellows Bootcamp, and landing a job at a tech company I admire. I also hope to hit 1 year without soda in July!
